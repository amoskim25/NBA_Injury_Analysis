    "# NBA Players Injury Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "The NBA has changed from the early 90's. Players seem stronger, bigger and faster. Rules like hand-checking no longer exist, the 3 pointer has become a key focus to winning a championship(Golden State Warriors in 2014-15). One thing common in the NBA from then and now is injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Injuries are detrimental to any team. When a Star Player gets injured the cost is not only potential wins but millions of dollars lost from injured players salaries and potential tickets sales. Fans don't want to pay for the price of admission to watch their star player on the bench in street clothes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kobe Bryant sustains Achilles Injury in 2013: \n",
    "    - miss 73 games\n",
    "    - Salary: 30,453,805 \n",
    "    - Cost to LA Lakers: \n",

    "# Goal\n",
    "Create a list of key features that attribute to high injury rates. To do this I will focus on games played for each player in a season and Average per game Player stats. This list will help provide the coaching staff with insights/indicators to focus on monitoring the health of a player based on their stats and adjust accordingly to maximize games played in a season.\n",
